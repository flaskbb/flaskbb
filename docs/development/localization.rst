Localization
============

FlaskBB uses `Transifex`_ for crowdsourced translations.


Getting Started
---------------

If you are interested in translating FlaskBB you need an Transifex acconut.

TODO:
- How to add a new language?

- What about existing languages?

- How are translations proofread?

- When are they pulled into the repository & when should a translation be finished?

- What is the context of a particular string?

- How to test *your* translations on a your local copy of FlaskBB?

- What about Plugins? Especially the official ones. This is especially important as there is no documentation on how to translate one.

- What happens when the source language string is changed?
