  users from viewing them (PR #325)

  Plugins are now loaded via entry points and thus have to be installed
  into the same environment as FlaskBB. During this migration we also moved
  the [portal plugin](https://github.com/sh4nks/flaskbb-plugins) into its own
  python package which can be installed via
  ``pip install flaskbb-plugin-portal``. (PR #311)

* Improve logging. (PR #327)
* Prefixes migrations with a timestamp which will sort them by creation date. (PR #353)
* Transform views into Class-based Views. (PR #324)
* Drop the tables instead of dropping the database when uninstalling FlaskBB. (PR #364)
* Create the database using SQLAlchemy's ``db.create_all`` and stamp it as
  'latest' instead of going through all migrations.
* Fixes a bug that prevented users to activate their accounts via the form
  input.
* Fixes a translations bug that wouldn't take the territory code into account
  when choosing a language (#299).
* Fixes a bug which would not show all conversations in the conversations view.
* Fixes a bug that made a forum section inaccessible when the ``last_post_id``
  of a topic was set to None.
* Various translations updated.
